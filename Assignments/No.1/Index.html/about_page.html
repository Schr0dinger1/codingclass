  	<h1>About</h1>

	<p>I am senior high school student currently attending City arts and technology Highschool. I'm very interestest in coding class and I've always wanted to learn so that I can create my own video games. I've had some coding experience in the past. I have some experience with using Python and very limited experience using java. Python was the first langauge I picked up when I was in middle school and I continued to practice it off and on. In 8th grade I scripted a very crude and simple review game for my Teacher to help my peers review for the then upcomming STAR test. The only reason I know the little Java I do is because I found the coding file for a game called "Luftrauser" and I reprogrammed its files to change the game a bit (changed the spawnrates of enemies, more powerful weapons and health for me, and other stuff)<p>

  	<p>This website was part of a project from Coding class that allowed our class to practice skills we have learned and put them to the test. The only instructions we recieved that the time were to copy a picture of a website as closely as possible and to create specific folders to house the code files(Which weren't very clear and quickly lead to the beginning of several of my classmates(including my own) frustration and confusion with the project. This project was much harder than orginally expected and the lack of instructions from our teacher further compounded the diffuculty. This lead many of us to grow very frustrated towards our work for the project as well as our teacher. We rarely recieved assistance with the project from our teacher and the only times we ever recieved helps were in his few hints he gave to the class. This made several students look towards each other for infomation and advice on how to recreate the desired webpage.</p>
